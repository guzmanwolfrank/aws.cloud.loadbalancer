# aws.cloud.loadbalancer
Quick help script for building an ec2 instance with a load balancer in AWS Cloud.  Work in progress! 


Instructions:  

Sign up for an AWS account, if you don't already have one.

Launch an EC2 instance and configure it to your liking. You will need to choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that has the necessary software installed (e.g., Python). You will also need to choose a type and size for your instance, and configure any security groups or networking settings as needed.

Connect to your EC2 instance using SSH. This can be done using a terminal program like PuTTY on Windows, or the ssh command on Linux or Mac.

Once you are connected to your EC2 instance, you can use Python to create a minimal load balancer.
